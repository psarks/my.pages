Before Daca I was not sure if I was going to have a purpose in this world. I am grateful for the opportunity I have been given to be able to finish school at University of California, San Diego and pursue a career in technology. As a child, I was lucky enough to learn how to improve my own computer.  Do NOT hesitate lets communicate!!',
